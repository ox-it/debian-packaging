Description: RDF library containing an RDF triple store and RDF/XML parser/serializer
 RDFLib is a Python library for working with RDF, a simple yet
 powerful language for representing information. The library
 contains an RDF/XML parser/serializer that conforms to the
 RDF/XML Syntax Specification and both in-memory and persistent 
 Graph backend.
 .
 This package also provides a serialization format converter
 called rdfpipe in order to deal with the different formats
 RDFLib works with.
